ALife

## Usage
First, the requirements need to be installed:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt`
```

Then, a model can be trained for the `baselines/deepq` cartpole example, and running the agent based on the trained model:
```bash
# This would take a while
python alife/main.py --train

python alife/main.py
```
